"""
This module provides scipy versions of high_pass_filter, and low_pass_filter
as well as an additional band_pass_filter.

Of course, you will need to install scipy for these to work.

When this module is imported the high and low pass filters from this module
will be used when calling audio_segment.high_pass_filter() and
audio_segment.high_pass_filter() instead of the slower, less powerful versions
provided by pydub.effects.

    """
    Args:
        freq: The cutoff frequency for highpass and lowpass filters. For
            band filters, a list of [low_cutoff, high_cutoff]
        type: "lowpass", "highpass", or "band"
        order: nth order butterworth filter (default: 5th order). The
            attenuation is -6dB/octave beyond the cutoff frequency (for 1st
            order). A Higher order filter will have more attenuation, each level
            adding an additional -6dB (so a 3rd order butterworth filter would
            be -18dB/octave).

    Returns:
        function which can filter a mono audio segment
