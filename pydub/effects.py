    Keyword Arguments:
        
        threshold - default: -20.0
            Threshold in dBFS. default of -20.0 means -20dB relative to the
            maximum possible volume. 0dBFS is the maximum possible value so
            all values for this argument sould be negative.

        ratio - default: 4.0
            Compression ratio. Audio louder than the threshold will be 
            reduced to 1/ratio the volume. A ratio of 4.0 is equivalent to
            a setting of 4:1 in a pro-audio compressor like the Waves C1.
        
        attack - default: 5.0
            Attack in milliseconds. How long it should take for the compressor
            to kick in once the audio has exceeded the threshold.

        release - default: 50.0
            Release in milliseconds. How long it should take for the compressor
            to stop compressing after the audio has falled below the threshold.
