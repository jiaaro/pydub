# v0.16.6
- Make `pydub.AudioSegment()` objects playable inline in ipython notebooks.
- Add scipy powered high pass, low pass, and band pass filters, which can be high order filters (they take `order` as a keyword argument).

- Add a workaround for incorrect duration reporting of some mp3 files on macOS

# v0.16.4
- Add support for radd (basically, allow `sum()` to operate on an iterable of `pydub.AudioSegment()` objects)
- Fix bug in 24-bit wav support (understatement. It didn't work right at all the first time)

# v0.16.3
- Add support for python 3.5 (overstatement. We just added python 3.5 to CI and it worked ðŸ˜„)
- Add native support for 24-bit wav files (ffmpeg/avconv not required)

# v0.16.2
- Fix bug where you couldn't directly instantiate `pydub.AudioSegment` with `bytes` data in python 3

# v0.16.1
- pydub will use any ffmpeg/avconv binary that's in the current directory (as reported by `os.getcwd()`) before searching for a system install

# v0.16.0
- Make it easier to instantiate `pydub.AudioSegment()` directly when creating audio segments from raw audio data (without having to write it to a file first)
- Add `pydub.AudioSegment().get_array_of_samples()` method which returns the samples which make up an audio segment (you should usually prefer this over `pydub.AudioSegment().raw_data`)
- Add `pydub.AudioSegment().raw_data` property which returns the raw audio data for an audio segment as a bytes (python 3) or a bytestring (python 3)
- Allow users to specify frame rate in `pydub.AudioSegment.silent()` constructor

# v0.15.0
- Add support for RAW audio (basically WAV format, but without wave headers)
- Add a new exception `pydub.exceptions.CouldntDecodeError` to indicate a failure of ffmpeg/avconv to decode a file (as indicated by ffmpeg/avconv exit code)

# v0.14.2
- Fix a bug in python 3.4 which failed to read wave files with no audio data (should have been audio segments with a duration of 0 ms)

# v0.14.1
- Fix a bug in `pydub.utils.mediainfo()` that caused inputs containing unescaped characters to raise a runtime error (inputs are not supposed to require escaping)

# v0.14.0
- Rename `pydub.AudioSegment().set_gain()` to `pydub.AudioSegment().apply_gain_stereo()` to better reflect it's place in the world (as a counterpart to `pydub.AudioSegment().apply_gain()`)

# v0.13.0
- Add `pydub.AudioSegment().pan()` which returns a new stereo audio segment panned left/right as specified.

# v0.12.0
- Add a logger, `"pydub.converter"` which logs the ffmpeg commands being run by pydub.
- Add `pydub.AudioSegment().split_to_mono()` method which returns a list of mono audio segments. One for each channel in the original audio segment.
- Fix a bug in `pydub.silence.detect_silence()` which caused the function to break when a silent audio segment was equal in length to the minimum silence length. It should report a single span of silence covering the whole silent audio segment. Now it does.
- Fix a bug where uncommon wav formats (those not supported by the stdlib wave module) would throw an exception rather than converting to a more common format via ffmpeg/avconv

# v0.11.0
- Add `pydub.AudioSegment().max_dBFS` which reports the loudness (in dBFS) of the loudest point (i.e., highest amplitude sample) of an audio segment

# v0.10.0
- Overhaul Documentation
- Improve performance of `pydub.AudioSegment().overlay()`
- Add `pydub.AudioSegment().invert_phase()` which (shocker) inverts the phase of an audio segment
- Fix a type error in `pydub.AudioSegment.get_sample_slice()`

# v0.9.5
- Add `pydub.generators` module containing simple signal generation functions (white noise, sine, square wave, etc)
- Add a `loops` keyword argument to `pydub.AudioSegment().overlay()` which allows users to specify that the overlaid audio should be repeated (i.e., looped) a certain number of times, or indefinitely

# 0.9.4
- Fix a bug in db_to_float() where all values were off by a factor of 2

# 0.9.3
- Allow users to set the location of their converter by setting `pydub.AudioSegment.converter = "/path/to/ffmpeg"` and added a shim to support the old method of assigning to `pydub.AudioSegment.ffmpeg` (which is deprecated now that we support avconv)

# v0.9.2
- Add support for Python 3.4
- Audio files opened with format "wave" are treated as "wav" and "m4a" are treated as "mp4"
- Add `pydub.silence` module with simple utilities for detecting and removing silence.
- Fix a bug affecting auto-detection of ffmpeg/avconv on windows.
- Fix a bug that caused pydub to only work when ffmpeg/avconv is present (it should be able to work with WAV data without any dependencies)

# v0.9.1
- Add a runtime warning when ffmpeg/avconv cannot be found to aid debugging

# v0.9.0
- Added support for pypy (by reimplementing audioop in python). Also, we contributed our implementation to the pypy project, so that's ðŸ’¯
- Add support for avconv as an alternative to ffmpeg
- Add a new helper module `pydub.playback` which allows you to quickly listen to an audio segment using ffplay (or avplay)
- Add new function `pydub.utils.mediainfo('/path/to/audio/file.ext')` which reports back the results of ffprobe (or avprobe) including codec, bitrate, channels, etc
