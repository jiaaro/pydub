##  Quickstart

Open a WAV file

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment

song = AudioSegment.from_wav("never_gonna_give_you_up.wav")
```

...or a mp3

```python
song = AudioSegment.from_mp3("never_gonna_give_you_up.mp3")
```

... or an ogg, or flv, or [anything else ffmpeg supports](http://www.ffmpeg.org/general.html#File-Formats)

```python
ogg_version = AudioSegment.from_ogg("never_gonna_give_you_up.ogg")
flv_version = AudioSegment.from_flv("never_gonna_give_you_up.flv")

mp4_version = AudioSegment.from_file("never_gonna_give_you_up.mp4", "mp4")
wma_version = AudioSegment.from_file("never_gonna_give_you_up.wma", "wma")
aac_version = AudioSegment.from_file("never_gonna_give_you_up.aiff", "aac")
```

Slice audio:

```python
# pydub does things in milliseconds
ten_seconds = 10 * 1000

first_10_seconds = song[:ten_seconds]

last_5_seconds = song[-5000:]
```

Make the beginning louder and the end quieter

```python
# boost volume by 6dB
beginning = first_10_seconds + 6

# reduce volume by 3dB
end = last_5_seconds - 3
```

Concatenate audio (add one file to the end of another)

```python
without_the_middle = beginning + end
```

How long is it?

```python
without_the_middle.duration_seconds == 15.0
```

AudioSegments are immutable

```python
# song is not modified
backwards = song.reverse()
```

Crossfade (again, beginning and end are not modified)

```python
# 1.5 second crossfade
with_style = beginning.append(end, crossfade=1500)
```

Repeat

```python
# repeat the clip twice
do_it_over = with_style * 2
```

Fade (note that you can chain operations because everything returns
an AudioSegment)

```python
# 2 sec fade in, 3 sec fade out
awesome = do_it_over.fade_in(2000).fade_out(3000)
```

Save the results (again whatever ffmpeg supports)

```python
awesome.export("mashup.mp3", format="mp3")
```

Save the results with tags (metadata)

```python
awesome.export("mashup.mp3", format="mp3", tags={'artist': 'Various artists', 'album': 'Best of 2011', 'comments': 'This album is awesome!'})
```

You can pass an optional bitrate argument to export using any syntax ffmpeg 
supports.

```python
awesome.export("mashup.mp3", format="mp3", bitrate="192k")
```

Any further arguments supported by ffmpeg can be passed as a list in a 
'parameters' argument, with switch first, argument second. Note that no 
validation takes place on these parameters, and you may be limited by what 
your particular build of ffmpeg/avlib supports.

```python
# Use preset mp3 quality 0 (equivalent to lame V0)
awesome.export("mashup.mp3", format="mp3", parameters=["-q:a", "0"])

# Mix down to two channels and set hard output volume
awesome.export("mashup.mp3", format="mp3", parameters=["-ac", "2", "-vol", "150"])
```

## Debugging

Most issues people run into are related to converting between formats using
ffmpeg/avlib. Pydub provides a logger that outputs the subprocess calls to 
help you track down issues:

```python
>>> import logging

>>> l = logging.getLogger("pydub.converter")
>>> l.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
>>> l.addHandler(logging.StreamHandler())

>>> AudioSegment.from_file("./test/data/test1.mp3")
subprocess.call(['ffmpeg', '-y', '-i', '/var/folders/71/42k8g72x4pq09tfp920d033r0000gn/T/tmpeZTgMy', '-vn', '-f', 'wav', '/var/folders/71/42k8g72x4pq09tfp920d033r0000gn/T/tmpK5aLcZ'])
<pydub.audio_segment.AudioSegment object at 0x101b43e10>
```

Don't worry about the temporary files used in the conversion. They're cleaned up 
automatically.

## Bugs & Questions

You can file bugs in our [github issues tracker](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub/issues), 
and ask any technical questions on 
[Stack Overflow using the pydub tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=pydub). 
We keep an eye on both.

## Installation

Installing pydub is easy, but don't forget to install ffmpeg/avlib (the next section in this doc)

    pip install pydub

Or install the latest dev version from github (or replace `@master` with a [release version like `@v0.12.0`](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub/releases))…

    pip install git+https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub.git@master

-OR-

    git clone https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub.git

-OR-

Copy the pydub directory into your python path. Zip 
[here](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub/zipball/master)

## Dependencies

You can open and save WAV files with pure python. For opening and saving non-wav 
files – like mp3 – you'll need [ffmpeg](http://www.ffmpeg.org/) or 
[libav](http://libav.org/).

### Playback

You can play audio if you have one of these installed (simpleaudio _strongly_ recommended, even if you are installing ffmpeg/libav):

 - [simpleaudio](https://simpleaudio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
 - [pyaudio](https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/docs/#)
 - ffplay (usually bundled with ffmpeg, see the next section)
 - avplay (usually bundled with libav, see the next section)
 
```python
from pydub import AudioSegment
from pydub.playback import play

sound = AudioSegment.from_file("mysound.wav", format="wav")
play(sound)
```

## Getting ffmpeg set up

You may use **libav or ffmpeg**.

Mac (using [homebrew](http://brew.sh)):

```bash
# libav
brew install libav --with-libvorbis --with-sdl --with-theora

####    OR    #####

# ffmpeg
brew install ffmpeg --with-libvorbis --with-sdl2 --with-theora
```

Linux (using aptitude):

```bash
# libav
apt-get install libav-tools libavcodec-extra

####    OR    #####

# ffmpeg
apt-get install ffmpeg libavcodec-extra
```

Windows:

1. Download and extract libav from [Windows binaries provided here](http://builds.libav.org/windows/).
2. Add the libav `/bin` folder to your PATH envvar
3. `pip install pydub`

## Important Notes

`AudioSegment` objects are [immutable](http://www.devshed.com/c/a/Python/String-and-List-Python-Object-Types/1/)


### Ogg exporting and default codecs

The Ogg specification ([http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5334](rfc5334)) does not specify
the codec to use, this choice is left up to the user. Vorbis and Theora are just
some of a number of potential codecs (see page 3 of the rfc) that can be used for the
encapsulated data.

When no codec is specified exporting to `ogg` will _default_ to using `vorbis`
as a convinence. That is:

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment
song = AudioSegment.from_mp3("test/data/test1.mp3")
song.export("out.ogg", format="ogg")  # Is the same as:
song.export("out.ogg", format="ogg", codec="libvorbis")
```

## Example Use

Suppose you have a directory filled with *mp4* and *flv* videos and you want to convert all of them to *mp3* so you can listen to  them on your mp3 player.

```python
import os
import glob
from pydub import AudioSegment

video_dir = '/home/johndoe/downloaded_videos/'  # Path where the videos are located
extension_list = ('*.mp4', '*.flv')

os.chdir(video_dir)
for extension in extension_list:
    for video in glob.glob(extension):
        mp3_filename = os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(video))[0] + '.mp3'
        AudioSegment.from_file(video).export(mp3_filename, format='mp3')
```

### How about another example?

```python
from glob import glob
from pydub import AudioSegment

playlist_songs = [AudioSegment.from_mp3(mp3_file) for mp3_file in glob("*.mp3")]

first_song = playlist_songs.pop(0)

# let's just include the first 30 seconds of the first song (slicing
# is done by milliseconds)
beginning_of_song = first_song[:30*1000]

playlist = beginning_of_song
for song in playlist_songs:

    # We don't want an abrupt stop at the end, so let's do a 10 second crossfades
    playlist = playlist.append(song, crossfade=(10 * 1000))

# let's fade out the end of the last song
playlist = playlist.fade_out(30)

# hmm I wonder how long it is... ( len(audio_segment) returns milliseconds )
playlist_length = len(playlist) / (1000*60)

# lets save it!
with open("%s_minute_playlist.mp3" % playlist_length, 'wb') as out_f:
    playlist.export(out_f, format='mp3')
```
