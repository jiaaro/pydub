# Pydub [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jiaaro/pydub.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/jiaaro/pydub)
Pydub let's you do stuff to audio in a way that isn't stupid.

##  Quickstart

Open a WAV file

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment

song = AudioSegment.from_wav("never_gonna_give_you_up.wav")
```
    
...or a mp3

```python
song = AudioSegment.from_mp3("never_gonna_give_you_up.mp3")
```
    
... or an ogg, or flv, or [anything else ffmpeg supports](http://www.ffmpeg.org/general.html#File-Formats)
    
```python
ogg_version = AudioSegment.from_ogg("never_gonna_give_you_up.ogg")
flv_version = AudioSegment.from_flv("never_gonna_give_you_up.flv")

mp4_version = AudioSegment.from_file("never_gonna_give_you_up.mp4", "mp4")
wma_version = AudioSegment.from_file("never_gonna_give_you_up.wma", "wma")
aac_version = AudioSegment.from_file("never_gonna_give_you_up.aiff", "aac")
```
    
Slice audio:
    
```python
# pydub does things in milliseconds
ten_seconds = 10 * 1000

first_10_seconds = song[:10000]

last_5_seconds = song[5000:]
```
    
Make the beginning louder and the end quieter
    
```python
# boost volume by 6dB
beginning = first_10_seconds + 6

# reduce volume by 3dB
end = last_5_seconds - 3
```
    
Concatenate audio (add one file to the end of another)

```python    
without_the_middle = beginning + end
```
    
How long is it?

```python
without_the_middle.duration_seconds == 15.0
```
    
AudioSegments are immutable

```python
# song is not modified
backwards = song.reverse()
```
    
Crossfade (again, beginning and end are not modified)
    
```python
# 1.5 second crossfade
with_style = beginning.append(end, crossfade=1500)
```

Repeat

```python
# repeat the clip twice
do_it_over = with_style * 2
```
    
Fade (note that you can chain operations because everything returns
an AudioSegment)
    
```python
# 2 sec fade in, 3 sec fade out
awesome = do_it_over.fade_in(2000).fade_out(3000)
```
    
Save the results (again whatever ffmpeg supports)

```python
awesome.export("mashup.mp3", format="mp3")
```   

Save the results with tags (metadata)

```python
awesome.export("mashup.mp3", format="mp3", tags={'artist': 'Various artists', 'album': 'Best of 2011', 'comments': 'This album is awesome!'})
```    

You can pass an optional bitrate argument to export using any syntax ffmpeg supports.

```python
awesome.export("mashup.mp3", format="mp3", bitrate="192k")
```    

Any further arguments supported by ffmpeg can be passed as a list in a 'parameters' argument, with switch first, argument second. Note that no validation takes place on these parameters, and you may be limited by what your particular build of ffmpeg supports.

```python
# Use preset mp3 quality 0 (equivalent to lame V0)
awesome.export("mashup.mp3", format="mp3", parameters=["-q:a", "0"])

# Mix down to two channels and set hard output volume
awesome.export("mashup.mp3", format="mp3", parameters=["-ac", "2", "-vol", "150"])
```    

## Installation

Copy the pydub directory into your python path. Zip [here](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub/zipball/master)

-OR-

    pip install pydub

-OR-

    git clone https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub.git

## Dependencies

Requires ffmpeg or avconv for encoding and decoding all non-wav files (which work natively)

 - ffmpeg (http://www.ffmpeg.org/)
 
 -OR-

 - avconv (http://libav.org/)

## Important Notes

`AudioSegment` objects are [immutable](http://www.devshed.com/c/a/Python/String-and-List-Python-Object-Types/1/)

## Example Use

Suppose you have a directory filled with *mp4* and *flv* videos and you want to convert all of them to *mp3* so you can listen to  them on your mp3 player.

```python
import os
import glob
from pydub import AudioSegment

video_dir = '/home/johndoe/downloaded_videos/'  # Path where the videos are located
extension_list = ('*.mp4', '*.flv')

os.chdir(video_dir)
for extension in extension_list:
    for video in glob.glob(extension):
        mp3_filename = os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(video))[0] + '.mp3'
        AudioSegment.from_file(video).export(mp3_filename, format='mp3')
```
    
### How about another example?

```python
from glob import glob
from pydub import AudioSegment

playlist_songs = [AudioSegment.from_mp3(mp3_file) for mp3_file in glob("*.mp3")]

first_song = playlist_songs.pop(0)

# let's just include the first 30 seconds of the first song (slicing 
# is done by milliseconds)
beginning_of_song = first_song[:30*1000]

playlist = beginning_of_song
for song in playlist_songs:

    # We don't want an abrupt stop at the end, so let's do a 10 second crossfades
    playlist.append(song, crossfade=(10 * 1000))

# let's fade out the end of the last song
playlist = playlist.fade_out(30)

# hmm I wonder how long it is... ( len(audio_segment) returns milliseconds )
playlist_length = len(playlist) / (1000*60)

# lets save it!
out_f = open("%s_minute_playlist.mp3" % playlist_length, 'wb')

playlist.export(out_f, format='mp3')
```

### Yet another Example?

Let's say you have a weekly podcast and you want to do the processing automatically.

For this example we're going to:
 
  - Strip out the silence
  - Add on the bumpers (intro/outro theme music)

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment
from pydub.utils import db_to_float

# Let's load up the audio we need...
podcast = AudioSegment.from_mp3("podcast.mp3")
intro = AudioSegment.from_wav("intro.wav")
outro = AudioSegment.from_wav("outro.wav")

# Let's consider anything that is 30 decibels quieter than
# the average volume of the podcast to be silence
average_loudness = podcast.rms
silence_threshold = average_loudness * db_to_float(-30)

# filter out the silence
podcast_parts = (ms for ms in podcast if ms.rms > silence_threshold)

# combine all the chunks back together
podcast = reduce(lambda a, b: a + b, podcast_parts)

# add on the bumpers
podcast = intro + podcast + outro

# save the result
podcast.export("podcast_processed.mp3", format="mp3")
```




    
Not bad!
